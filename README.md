Hey there, this is going to be my second Astro template to showcase. As the title said, it's an Astro template without any complex designing.
This template is made with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for the Front-end.

You can [create an Issue](https://github.com/lancerossdev/nofuss/issues/new) or submit a Pull Request if you think there's something wrong or you want to add a new feature on this template. I will appreciate your help!

## Dev Notes 📝

You can use `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies. I personally use `pnpm` because it's what I use on most of my projects.

`pnpm install` - Installs dependencies. You can use any of those.

`pnpm dev` - Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`

`pnpm build` - Build your production site to `./dist/`

`pnpm preview` - Preview your build locally, before deploying
