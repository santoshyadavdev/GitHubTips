## Keeping Your GitHub Repo Clean with a Monorepo
Managing multiple projects or modules in a GitHub repository can quickly lead to clutter and disorganization. Fortunately, using a monorepo can help to simplify the process and keep your repository clean and organized.

## What is a Monorepo?
A monorepo is a single repository that contains multiple projects or modules, rather than having a separate repository for each project or module. Using a monorepo can help to reduce clutter, improve code sharing and collaboration, and make it easier to manage multiple projects.

## How to Use a Monorepo
To use a monorepo effectively, it's important to have a clear and consistent directory structure. Each project or module should have its own directory within the monorepo, and dependencies should be managed carefully to avoid conflicts.

You can also use tools such as [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) or [Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) to manage dependencies and build processes across multiple projects within the monorepo. These tools can help to simplify the process of building and testing code across multiple projects, and ensure that all projects within the monorepo are up to date and compatible with each other.

## Benefits of Using a Monorepo
Using a monorepo can provide a number of benefits for managing your GitHub repository, including:

* Simplifying the process of managing multiple projects or modules
* Reducing clutter and improving organization within the repository
* Promoting code sharing and collaboration between projects
* Making it easier to manage dependencies and ensure compatibility between projects
* Improving version control and history tracking for multiple projects

## Conclusion

If you're working on multiple projects or modules within a GitHub repository, using a monorepo can be an effective way to keep your repository clean and organized. By carefully managing your directory structure and using tools such as lerna or Yarn workspaces, you can simplify the process of managing and collaborating on code within the monorepo, and ensure that all projects within the repository are up to date and compatible with each other.
